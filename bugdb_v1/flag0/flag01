(FLAG)[@BigGuy573]
The left side is the QUERY and the RIGHT side is results.

There is also a very clear structure of data at very right side for reference.

So just make a query to loop through all the details of the data set.

query{ user { edges { node { id username { bugs { pageInfo { startCursor { endCursor }
          edges { curser { node { id { reporterId { text { private { reporter { id}
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
{[(And here comes the)][*][flag]}.
